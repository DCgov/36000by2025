---
The purpose of this site is to track housing production in support of the <a href="https://planning.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/op/page_content/attachments/2019-036%20Housing%20Initiative%20%285.9%29.pdf"> Mayor’s goal</a> of producing 36,000 new housing units and 12,000 affordable units by 2025.  For more information on this target and an overview of how the District is working to achieve this goal, please visit 
<a href=" https://housing.dc.gov/"> https://housing.dc.gov/</a>. 

In order to more fully capture the District’s efforts to create new, dedicated affordable housing units and to better align with agency housing goals and strategies the below dashboard was updated as part of the September 2022 monthly update.

<b>Note:</b> The September 2022 housing count included an update to the housing count methodology to incorporate 1) projects that create New Affordable Units by placing covenants on existing housing units without an affordability covenant and 2) projects funded through the Housing Preservation Fund that include New Affordable Units.

These changes bring the affordable unit count into alignment with goals and strategies stated in the Housing Equity Report and the 2021 DHCD Consolidated RFP for Affordable Housing Projects.
